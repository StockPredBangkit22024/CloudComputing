## Google Cloud
Google Cloud is a cloud-based service provider platform with many services that support application and technology development. With many services available such as IaaS for infrastructure development, PaaS for platforms as users can develop and run applications in serverless and SaaS are applications provided by providers that are already running on the Cloud. 

We use service from Google Cloud like :
- Cloud Run
- Cloud IAM
- Cloud Storage


## Technology Used 

**Cloud Run**

Cloud Run is a service that allows you to deploy applications more easily because it is serverless and built using containerization.


**Cloud IAM**

Cloud IAM allows administrators to authorize who can take action on specific resources, giving you full control and visibility to centrally manage Google Cloud resources.

**Cloud Storage**

We use this service to store images in the form of links, so that the links can be inserted into the SQL Cloud so that they can be consumed by the MD team.
